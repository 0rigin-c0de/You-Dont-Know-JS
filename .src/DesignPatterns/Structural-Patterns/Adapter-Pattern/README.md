## The Adapter allows two objects with incompatible interfaces to interact with each other. Let's say, for example, that your application consults an API that returns XML and sends that information to another API to process that information. But the processing API expects JSON. You can't send the information as it's received since both interfaces are incompatible. You need to adapt it first. ðŸ˜‰
