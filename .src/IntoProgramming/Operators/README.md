Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:

Assignment: ``=`` as in ``a = 2``.

Math: ``+`` (addition), ``-`` (subtraction), ``*`` (multiplication), and ``/`` (division), as in ``a * 3``.

Compound Assignment: ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``, and ``/=`` are compound operators that combine a math operation with an assignment, as in ``a += 2`` (same as a = a + 2).

Increment/Decrement: ``++`` (increment), ``--`` (decrement), as in ``a++`` (similar to ``a = a + 1)``.

Object Property Access ``.`` as in ``console.log()``.

Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. ``obj. a`` means an object value called ``obj`` with a property of the name ``a``. Properties can alternatively be accessed as ``obj["a"]``. See Chapter 2.

Equality: ``==`` (loose-equals), ``===`` (strict-equals), ``!=`` (loose not-equals), ``!==`` (strict not-equals), as in ``a == b``.

Comparison: ``<`` (less than), ``>`` (greater than), ``<=`` (less than or loose-equals), ``>=``(greater than or loose-equals), as in ``a <= b``.

Logical: ``&&`` (and), ``||`` (or), as in a ``||`` b that selects either ``a or b``.
